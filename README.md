## Project Introduction

This is the `jupyter lab` project of `Fair-NE`, a fair peer recommender based on DeBayes by Buyl and De Bie (2020). There are two notebook files: `preprocessing` and `network_embeddings`. The `preprocessing` file constructs edges from students' posts and replies. There was also some visualization on students' traffic in that notebook. `network_embeddings` is the main file that trains and evaluates the models: FairNE, FairWalk, and Node2Vec.
